            In his youth he became the head of a hostel.
            
            When the hostel guest,

            (Long-lived Mulberry?),
            
            stopped by, 
            <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span> alone found him remarkable and often treated 
            him with respect. <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-changsang">Mister Ch'ang-sang</span> also recognized that 
            <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span> was not an ordinary man. Only after coming and 
            going for more than 
            ten years did he [<span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-changsang">Mister Ch'ang-sang</span>] 
            summon <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span> to sit with him in private and secretly
            
            said to him: 
            "I have a secret [medical] formula. I am growing old and would like to hand it on to you, Sir. 
            You must not disclose it." 
            <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span> said, 
            "I respectfully promise." 
            Then he took out some medicinal herbs from the inside of his jacket and gave them to 
            <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span>. 
            "Drink these [herbs] with water from the surface of a pond
            
            and after 
            thirty days you will be able to discern things [regarding illnesses]!"
            
            
            Then he took all the documents of his secret formulae and gave them entirely to 
            <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span>. Suddenly he disappeared—probably he was not 
            a human being.

          <p>
            After <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-pien_chueh">Pien Ch'üeh</span>, as he had said, had drunk the herbs 
            for thirty days, he could see a person on the other side of a low wall. 
            Using this when examining patients, he could completely see the concretions and knots in the 
            five viscera 五臟.
            
            When he practiced medicine [however] he did so solely under the name of 
            diagnosing pulses.
            
            Solely by means of taking pulses he became famous. As a physician he was sometimes in

              <p>Master Ch'ang-sang 長桑公 is mentioned several 
              times in various early texts: in the <span class="tei-title">Chen kao 真誥</span> (chüan 14, fol. 15b) he is 
              said to be <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="person-zhuangzi">Chuang Tzu's</span> master, in the Taoist collectanea 
              <span class="tei-title">Yin-chi ch'i-ch'ien 雲笈七籤</span> he is depicted as a recluse who went about with 
              his hair down singing cryptic songs (chüan 110, fol. 1b), and in the <span class="tei-title">Shen-hsien chuan 神仙傳</span> 
              is said to have been the master of Yü Tzu 于子 (chüan 4, fol. 6a).</p>
              
              <p>On why he has the epithet "mulberry," two explanations seem tenable. The first follows the 
              association of the mulberry with the fecundity of the grove where only women worked (cf. the 
              luxuriance of the mulberry in <span class="tei-title">"Hsi sang" 隰桑</span> Mao #228 or <span class="tei-title">"Sang jou" 桑柔</span> 
              Mao #257, of the <span class="tei-title">Shih ching 詩經</span>). More likely is the second explanation that the 
              mulberry itself is long-lived and thus symbolizes the "father" or "ancestor"—in this case of 
              medicine—as in <span class="tei-title">"Hsiao pien" 小弁</span> (Mao #197).</p>

              literally "water on the top of a pond," indicates water than has not yet reached the ground such as 
              dew that collects on plants. The <span class="tei-title">Cheng-yi</span> suggests it might refer to dew collected 
              in special containers. But the literal meaning or water from the top of a pool or pond may also 
              obtain here. Nakai Riken 中井履軒 (1732-1817) explains that such pure water

              <p>Both apparently were grand masters of 
              <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="place-qin">Ch'in</span>. Noble Scion Chih 支 
              (Chih 枝 in the <span class="tei-title">Tso chuan</span>, agnomen 
              Tzu-sang 子桑) was an advisor to 
              Duke Mu (cf. Yang, Tso, Hsi 9 and 13, pp. 331 and 349; 
              Fang Hsüan-ch'en, p. 184, #349). Aoki (p. 147n.) argues that 
              Tzu-yü refers to the Tzu-ch'e 子車 Clan of 
              <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="place-qin">Ch'in</span> (see also <span class="tei-title">Shih chi</span>, 5.194, 
              <span class="tei-title">Grand Scribe's Records</span>, 1:102 and the commentary on Yang, Tso, Wen 6, pp. 546-7), 
              but this still does not make clear who this particular member of the clan was. 
              Chavannes (5:25) believes Tzu-yü was the father of the 
              three Tzu-yü clansmen buried with Duke Mu, 
              but it seems safest to note that Tzu-yü (or 
              Tzu-ch'e) was a <span class="popover-trigger" popovertarget="place-qin">Ch'in</span> clan and that, as 
              Takigawa (105.4) notes, the exact person referred to here can not be determined.</p>
